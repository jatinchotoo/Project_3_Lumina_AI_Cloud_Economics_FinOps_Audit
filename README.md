## 🧠 Business Intelligence Summary
Lumina AI is an executive-grade FinOps intelligence platform designed to bridge the gap between technical cloud utilization and CFO-level capital allocation. The system transforms raw telemetry from **10,000+ compute nodes** into decision-ready financial signals.

**Note:** *Designed to mirror real-world FinOps audits conducted at enterprise cloud scale.*

### 📝 Audit Scope & Assumptions
To ensure financial accuracy and operational safety, the following parameters were applied:
* **Timeframe:** Audit based on 30-day rolling utilization averages.
* **Pricing:** Cost rates derived from blended regional on-demand pricing for London, Cape Town, and New York.
* **Governance:** High-availability (HA) nodes are flagged and excluded from shutdown logic to prevent operational risk.
* **Data:** Built using anonymized infrastructure telemetry representative of enterprise-scale cloud environments.

## 🎯 The Problem
Organizations operating at scale face "Technical Debt" in the form of financial leakage. Idle or underutilized instances consume capital without delivering ROI, and these costs are often hidden behind technical metrics that lack financial context.

---

## ⚙️ Audit Logic & Classification
Every infrastructure node is evaluated using specific financial rules:

* **🔴 CRITICAL: SHUTDOWN** (CPU < 5% + High Hourly Cost) → Immediate financial leakage identified.
* **🟡 MAINTAIN** (Moderate utilization) → Acceptable performance; monitor for trends.
* **🟢 OPTIMAL** (Efficient utilization) → Optimal capital deployment.

---

## 🛠️ Technology & Methodology
* **FinOps Lifecycle:** Aligned with the *Inform → Optimize → Operate* framework.
* **Excel (Power Pivot):** High-performance financial modeling and analytics engine.
* **Regional Benchmarking:** Comparative cost analysis across global cloud regions.
* **ZAR-Localized Modeling:** Finance-led cloud economics focused on South African market context.
