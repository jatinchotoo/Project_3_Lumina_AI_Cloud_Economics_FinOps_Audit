# ☁️ Lumina AI  
## Cloud Economics, FinOps & Capital Efficiency Intelligence Platform

> **Executive-grade FinOps audit and decision intelligence system designed to identify infrastructure waste, optimize cloud spend, and support CFO / CTO capital allocation decisions.**

---

## 🧠 Executive Summary

**Lumina AI** is a finance-led cloud economics and FinOps analytics platform that audits large-scale infrastructure environments to detect **idle capacity, cost leakage, and capital inefficiencies**.

The solution analyzes **10,000+ compute nodes** across multiple regions, classifies resource efficiency using financial and operational thresholds, and translates raw telemetry into **board-level cost-reduction insights**.

This project demonstrates **real-world capability** in:
- Finance Transformation
- FinOps & Cloud Economics
- Executive Analytics
- Automation-driven cost governance

## 🎯 Business Problem

Cloud infrastructure spend is often treated as a fixed IT cost rather than a **controllable financial asset**.

Organizations struggle with:
- Zombie instances consuming capital with no business value
- Lack of finance-grade visibility into cloud economics
- Poor linkage between technical metrics and financial outcomes
- Manual, error-prone cost reviews

**Lumina AI addresses this gap.**

## ⚙️ Audit Logic & Classification Framework

Each infrastructure node is evaluated using deterministic financial rules:

### Efficiency Rules
- **CPU Utilization < 5%** + High Hourly Cost ⇒ **CRITICAL: SHUTDOWN**
- Moderate utilization ⇒ **MAINTAIN**
- Efficient utilization ⇒ **OPTIMAL**

### Status Categories
- `OPTIMAL` – Efficient resource utilization
- `MAINTAIN` – Acceptable performance, monitor
- `CRITICAL: SHUTDOWN` – Immediate cost leakage identified

---

## 🌍 Regional Cost Benchmarking

The platform compares cloud economics across:
- **London**
- **Cape Town**
- **New York**

This enables:
- Identification of regional inefficiencies
- Cross-entity benchmarking
- Informed workload relocation decisions

---

## 💰 Financial Impact (ZAR)

| Metric | Value |
|------|------|
| Hourly Waste Identified | **R12,416.52** |
| Monthly Savings Opportunity | **~R8.9 Million** |
| Annual Capital Recovery Potential | **~R107 Million** |

> These figures demonstrate how small inefficiencies scale into **material financial risk** at enterprise level.
